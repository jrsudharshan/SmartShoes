# SmartShoes
This project was an effort towards helping people with abnormal walking patterns. The smart software is designed to learns the users walking patterns and help improve his walking style over time. 
Achieved using machine learning algorithms (Scikit-learn: Decision tree)

Smartshoes.py - Contains code to train the model and predict new classes.
Ndata.csv - File that contains the training data.
            Contains values for the five sensors and the class the data belongs to.
            In-Shoe Pressure Sensor values are in range (0,3) 0- Lowest 3- Highest.
            Classes: Sensor data is classified into 5 classes depending on pressure.
